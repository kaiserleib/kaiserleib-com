        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><strong>Kaiser Leib</strong> was born in Kalispell, Montana, because his parents lived there. Widely recognized as being smarter than everyone else during the earliest years of his life, he was very disappointed to learn that nobody cares.</p>

        <p>Kaiser wrestled badly in high school and was awarded a National Merit Scholarship, which he promptly lost due to drinking too much and never going to class. He graduated from the University of Montana, where he went because it was close and David went there. He was disappointed to learn that nobody cares about the National Merit Scholarship thing.</p>

        <p>Since then he's had a mediocre career doing mostly computer stuff. He started a software company and raised $5 million dollars but it turned out that people didn't want to buy what they were making, so he shut it down. He ran for Governor of Montana in 2024 on the Libertarian ticket, but it turned out that people aren't Libertarians, so he lost.</p>

        <p>He currently lives in Helena, Montana, with his 3d printer, his computer, and a cast iron skillet.</p>
        
        <p>He's a regular feature at Bozeman's Last Best Comedy Club, and he produces shows all around Montana under his 302 Comedy brand. He's opened for Josh Johnson, Rodney Norman, Andy Gold, Andy Woodhull, Aaron Woodall, and plenty of people whose names do not start with 'a'. </p>

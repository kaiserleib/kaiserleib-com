        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><strong>Kaiser Leib</strong> was born in Kalispell, MT, and is now based in Helena, MT. Kaiser got into comedy by performing at open mics in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood, and his humor can be described as abstract and intelligent.</p>

        <p>He performs regularly at Last Best Comedy in Bozeman, MT; The Lobby in Helena, MT; Canyon Ferry Brewing in Townsend, MT; The Covellite Theatre in Butte, MT, and occasionally elsewhere around the country.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to his comedy career, Kaiser won a National Merit Scholarship (which he promptly lost due to bad grades in college) and started a tech company, raising $5 million. After failing to gain traction, he returned half the money to the investors. Kaiser also takes pride in winning a sixth-grade spelling bee.</p>
        
        <p>On stage, Kaiser’s presence alternates between confident and anxious, with an understated delivery that keeps audiences on their toes.</p>
